# Udacity-Data-Analyst-Project_2-Analyzing-TMDB-Movie-Database-

The dataset chosen here gives information about 10,866 movies collected from The Movie Database from over a period of 56 years, i.e. 1961 to 2015. The data analyzed here is along the parameters of genre and years. Other main features analyzed in the dataset include, the movie budget along with budget adjusted for inflation, the revenue and inflation-adjusted revenue the movie generated, the popularity of the movie along with the number of votes it received.

Other features present in the dataset but not explored in the analysis include, cast, keywords, overviews and production companies. Production companies would have been an interesting feature to explore but it had too many missing values and was hence dropped.

Questions analyzed and answered in this project are as follows;

a) Highest Proportion of Movies by Genre

b) Popularity of Movies by Genre

c) Average Adjusted Budget by Genre

d) Average Adjusted Revenues by Genre

e) Average Revenue and Average Adjusted Revenue over the Years

f) Top 10 Movies with the Highest Revenues
